      %ra
      children you knew, at age 10, your[/left]

      father thought you ready to
      begin learning thieving[/left]

      skills. You spent many happy hours in
      his work shop,[/left]

      practicing initially %q1.[/left]

      Your skills
      developed slowly at first, and your father[/left]

      seemed to have to
      suppress his impatience at times.[/left]

      [/left]

      You applied
      yourself to your training more diligently[/left]

      than ever. It gradually
      became apparent to both you[/left]

      and your father that while you certainly
      would[/left]

      become a competent thief given time, you would never[/left]

      achieve
      his level of mastery.[/left]

      [/left]

      While you were studying
      %q3 techniques[/left]

      with your father, your mother began to teach you,
      in[/left]

      her quiet way, the use of magicka. It did not[/left]

      take
      long to determine that you had some definite[/left]

      potential. You discovered
      that you could use both[/left]

      sciences together, using the discipline
      from[/left]

      your %q3 and %q4[/left]

      training to accelerate your
      development of[/left]

      %q2 spells.[/left]

      [/left]

      Your
      mother introduced you to some unusual, non-human[/left]

      creatures, mostly
      %q5.[/left]

      You learned not only not to fear them, but also some of[/left]

      their
      language. One in particular, a female named %fn[/left]

      took a liking
      to you and trained you further in spells[/left]

      of %q6 than your mother
      ever could.[/left]

      [/left]

      One night, your father brought you
      into his shop, a[/left]

      serious expression on his face. He explained
      that an[/left]

      agent of the Emperor himself had approached the[/left]

      heads
      of the local Thieves and Mages Guild. He had told[/left]

      them that the
      Emperor had heard rumors of a[/left]

      %q8 named %b1n who was supposed
      to[/left]

      have been allied with the imperial traitor Jagar Tharn.[/left]

      The
      Emperor dared not act against %b1n[/left]

      without proper evidence to
      verify %b1g3 illegal actions.[/left]

      Your father suggested that, as
      a pair, you two were just[/left]

      right for the assignment. Excited about
      the chance[/left]

      to impress your father as much as the Emperor''s reward,[/left]

      you
      agreed at once.[/left]

      [/left]

      Some nights later, you and your
      father broke into[/left]

      %b1n''s study and began searching for[/left]

      evidence
      of conspiracy. A noise out in the hall[/left]

      nearly caused you to drop
      the stack of papers you were[/left]

      carrying. Quickly, as agreed before,
      you moved off to the[/left]

      exit route carrying %b1n''s materials[/left]

      while
      your father headed off to provide a distraction. He[/left]

      gave you
      a wink and disappeared. You left the castle, and[/left]

      followed the
      escape route to your home.[/left]

      [/left]

      There, a portly mage
      and an Imperial courier examined the[/left]

      materials, and from their
      reactions, the evidence damned[/left]

      %b1n. You sat with your mother
      and[/left]

      fretfully awaited your father''s return. The hours turned[/left]

      to
      days, and you numbly realized that you would never see[/left]

      your father
      again. The receipt of the Emperor''s reward[/left]

      seemed small consolation
      for your loss.[/left]

      [/left]

      Some weeks later, a letter bearing
      the Imperial seal[/left]

      arrived at your house. You were requested in
      the Imperial[/left]

      City at once.[/left]
